"\nThe translation of それでも is \"Still,Even if.\"\n\nIn terms of Japanese connotations, それでも often implies a sense of stubbornness, determination, or persistence, despite circumstances. It can translate to \"still\" or \"even if\" in a wide context, meaning not to give up or continue something, often despite resistance or negative circumstances. In some cases, それでも can be used to indicate a previous error that shall not happen again. Perhaps as a lesson learned or a vow not to repeat the mistake, it suggests a resolve to change. It carries a sense of strength and maturity, as one refuses to be deterred despite any odds."
