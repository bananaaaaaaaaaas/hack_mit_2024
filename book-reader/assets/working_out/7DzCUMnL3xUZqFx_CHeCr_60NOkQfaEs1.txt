"\nきて is an archaic writing representing a verb \"kami\" (天, \"ti\") in East Asian calligraphy.\n\nTo explain it to someone learning Japanese, ursing \"ki(te)\" could be interpreted as \"descending from the heavens\" or \"sent forth by the gods.\" This phrase could be seen in traditional poems or mythology in a metaphorical sense. In Japanese culture, it often connotes divine or supernatural origin. It can be a way to express powerful entities, like gods, goddesses, or heroes, bestowing or coming from the divine realm."
