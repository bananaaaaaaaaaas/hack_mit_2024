"\nそういうことで、 (Sou-juu toke=\"#\">\n\"So it's like\" or \"It's kind of, well\" can often indicate that there is some mild or amused communication about something off-camera.\n\nThis phrase is often used among friends or people who are in close relationships, when the speaker is discussing a situation or event that the listener is already completely aware of or implying that the listener should also be aware of it. It could be seen as a way to confirm a shared understanding or to express an opinion or need through a slight understatement or playfulness. This is a common idiomatic expression in spoken Japanese, used to soften the impact of a statement or to hint at the context without fully divulging it."
