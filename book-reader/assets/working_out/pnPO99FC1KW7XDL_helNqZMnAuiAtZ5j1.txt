"\nSo, according to context (especially when used around children) and common usage, it seems someone was speaking to you trying to convey a sentiment of affection, possibly nostalgia, or longing. This set of characters can also be used to emphasize or trail off after speaking, leaving something to the imagination or to the hearer's interpretation—the speaker might be feeling a bit lost in thought or contemplation. It could also be part of a phrase or part of an adjacent sentence.\n\nFor learners of Japanese, these characters might be challenging to master because they do not follow a typical phonetic pattern and are used more for nuanced emotional expression rather than scientific or BMI measurement. It's important to practice these types of complex characters to build a more versatile and expressive speaking vocabulary. The expression of 'そう' usually grabs attention and can set an emotional tone."
