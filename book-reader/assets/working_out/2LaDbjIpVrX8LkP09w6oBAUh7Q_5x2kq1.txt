"\nIf someone says \"それでも\" in Japanese, they are using a phrase that translates to \"Even then\" or \"Still\" in English.\n\nThe connotation behind \"それでも\" is to express something that has been resolved, whether it was inevitable or so matters that it cannot be avoided. This phrase often implies that a decision has already been made and there is now no choice but to accept it. It can also be a way of expressing resignation or acceptance of circumstances that cannot easily be changed. For example, \"それでも私は留学する\" (Soredemo watashi wa ryugaku suru) translates to \"Even then, I will go to college.\"\n\nIn fictional contexts, \"それでも\" is often used to introduce significant, life-altering decisions or inaction that sets a story in motion. The phrase draws attention to an event that significantly influences the plot and the characters' lives."
