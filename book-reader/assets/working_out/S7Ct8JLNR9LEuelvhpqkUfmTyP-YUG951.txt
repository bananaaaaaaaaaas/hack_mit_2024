"\nThe translation of それでも in English is \"so despite this,\" or \"and yet.\"\n\nIn Japanese, それでも refers to a situation where one continues to do something or be in a position despite circumstances that would discourage or refuse them to do so. It's often used to indicate a strong sense of determination, intention, or, in some cases, stubbornness or resilience. A person or thing is not deterred from their course of action, even in light of adversity or opposition. When someone continually does something それでも, it implies a clear intention to follow through with their goals regardless of the challenges."
