"\n\"それでも\" can be translated to \"Still\" in English.\n\nThe Japanese syllable \"で\" is often used to indicate a temporary pause or a break in the action a verb has been describing. \"んで\" roughly corresponds to \"and\" in English, but it implies a continuation of the same action after the pause. The combination \"それでも\" implies that despite a temporary pause or an obstacle, the action will continue in the same manner. For example, saying \"それでも、今日は行状町に行くそうです\" means \"I still plan to go to Ikebukuro today.\"\n\nIn the context of a spy novel, \"それでも\" could suggest that a spy mission continues despite unexpected challenges or interruptions while the mission remains uncompleted."
