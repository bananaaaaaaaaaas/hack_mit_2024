"\nそういうのは、 = saa without kana pronunciation (it changed due to the introduction of Hiragana and Katakana).\n\nThis phrase \"そういうのは\" (saawueno) is a contraction in Japanese, used to clarify or provide examples. It can roughly be translated to \"such a thing\" or \"that kind of thing\". If translated literally into English, it would sound something like \"like that\" or \"saawueno\". However, it's important to note that context is key, as it implies a connection to the previous sentence's topic, suggesting an example or specification related to what has been said before it."
