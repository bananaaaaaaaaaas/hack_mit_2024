"\nThe translated text \"そういうのは\" in English is \"like that\" or \"that kind of.\"\n\nThis text is a pronoun that refers back to the previous context, similar to any of the following:\n\n- それ (Sore, \"that thing\")\n- ご (Go, usually used in polite speech to refer to something you don't want to directly mention)\n- どれ (Dore, \"which one\")\n- その (Sono, \"that one\")\n- そのあれ (Son awareness, \"that one over there\")\n\nFor someone learning Japanese, the word \"そういうのは\" can be used after a verb, adjective, or participle to mean \"that thing\" or \"that kind of thing.\" It is often plural because it refers to more than one item. In natural speech, you might use \"そういう\" instead of \"そういうのは\" for a more informal tone, enabling contraction of the vowel sounds. The use of \"そういう\" often restricts the noun or pronoun to a single reference, whereas \"そういうのは\" can refer to multiple things."
