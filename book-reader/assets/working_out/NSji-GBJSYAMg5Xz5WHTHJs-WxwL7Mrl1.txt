"\nThe text \"きて、いって\" translates to \"come, come\" in English.\n\nIn Japanese, this phrase is often used informally to call someone, usually a friend or a family member, to come see something interesting or amusing, or to invite them to join an event or activity. If you're learning Japanese, keep in mind that these verbs are base conjugations, though, and to construct a proper sentence, you would have to check the tense and context to know what標準 (hyōjō, standard) they belong to. For example, if you want to say \"come and go,\" you could say \"来って、行ってって/ (Aittette, Aratteatte),\" which corresponds to a more casual or repeated invitation.\n\nRemember that in conversation, casual language like this helps to minimize formalities and promotes comfortable interaction among speakers."
