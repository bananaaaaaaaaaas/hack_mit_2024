"\nThe Japanese text \"それでも\" is translated to \"Still, after all\" in English.\n\nThe word \"それでも\" is comprised of \"それ\" (Sore), which simply means \"that,\" and \"でも\" (Demo), which often indicates a degree of persuasiveness, persistence, or concluding a discussion. \"それでも\" can be broken down as \"that\" and \"even though\" or \"still.\"\n\nWhen used in a sentence, it often implies something like \"no matter how much\" or \"despite.\" It can be used to express a strong intent or to reiterate the importance of a point despite any drawbacks. For example, \"それでも、僧僧死うと天国\" can be translated to \"Still, if a monk dies, he will go to heaven,\" emphasizing the promise of paradise even in the face of death.\n\nFor learners of Japanese, understanding that \"でも\" comes after the main clause indicating that the speaker overcomes an obstacle or clings to their point can help you construct the appropriate contexts for its use."
