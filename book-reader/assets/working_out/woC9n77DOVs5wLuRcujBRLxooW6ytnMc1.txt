"\n「それでも」 can be translated to \"despite\" or \"still\" in English.\n\nFrom a Japanese standpoint, this particle typically uses the conditional form before the verb to express that in a hypothetical scenario where a condition is met (often introducing unforeseen or extreme circumstances), the subject who possesses a certain emotional state will act a certain way. For example:\n\n lact (lactá «Watashi, soba no kissoku wo yctsō agedakedo, sore demo:')\n   Néôme (Nendetú nemkudesú)\n      Nonto michi, hojódé ogamisou\n      Néoké humidayo,\n         Tottoké jedoch wéwadai\n         Tennét zo gé.`\n   gé (ë)\n\nIn this sentence, it says \"Even though water is what's most desired by nature, hereafter that we'll hold any wealth, we'll cling to the lifeboat, so even at bitter odds let's support our promise view with thanks.\" It suggests that despite unfavorable circumstances or an extreme scenario, one should fulfill their promise and maintain the lifebuoy, or in this case, the wealth, even with no choice left."
