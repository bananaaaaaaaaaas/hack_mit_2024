"\n\"それでも、\" can be translated as \"Even so/amidst/anyway.\"\n\nThe Japanese particle それ (sore) is used to indicate that a prior condition or event still holds true even after another factor is introduced. It is a conjunction that indicates a condition or event is enduring despite the presence of something else. The particle でも (demo) is derived from a word that indicates effort or intention, and thereby implies continuous or current effort despite the mention of an opposing force.\n\nIn summary,endori, especially when used with other particles, means to continue with or amid something else."
