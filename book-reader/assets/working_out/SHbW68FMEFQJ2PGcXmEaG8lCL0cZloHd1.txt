"\nWill get rid of the original image before retranslating the text.\n\nText: \"スピヒ地 peripheral\"\n\nTranslation to English: The text appears to be a typo or a misinterpretation. It should likely be translated to \"Disordered or Clear.\" If you can clarify what \"スピ\" and \"ヒ地\" represent in the context of where you obtained the image, I can provide a better interpretation. The rest of the text, \"eijō\" (影像), likely refers to \"image\" or to the scene depicted.\n\nIn Japanese, \"すごく下手\" would mean \"so bad\" or \"not very good\" in the context of a skill or performance. It can be used to describe something that is poor or inadequate at an apparent or obvious level. The text you provided seems to be a combination of words or a misspelling, which doesn't fit the context of what it should mean."
