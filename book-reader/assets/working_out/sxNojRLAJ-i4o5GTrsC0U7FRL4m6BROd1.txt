"\nThe Japanese text ．．．生きて can be translated to \"live\" or \"live up\" in English.\n\nThe phrase appears to be a play on words. commanders. The word for \"commanders\" can also mean \"gods\" or \"supreme beings\" in a metaphysical or spiritual context. \"生きて\" lends itself to both meanings, making it a versatile term that can convey both practical life and divine power or authority.\n\nFor someone learning Japanese, it's important to understand that this term encompasses a broader meaning than what \"live\" might imply without context. It implies not just existence, but a quality of life that could be striving to achieve a divine or superhuman standard of existence, emphasizing a sense of resilience and the ability to overcome adversity."
