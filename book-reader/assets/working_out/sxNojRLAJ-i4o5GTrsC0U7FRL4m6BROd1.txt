"\nIn English, ．．．生きて would be \"Livingly\" or a way to describe something that is living, often in a vibrant or dynamic manner.\n\nIn Japanese, ．．．生きて can be broken down as:\n\n- ．．…-(muhon) is a common suffix used to indicate a verb or an action subject, depending on the context.\n- live (i.e., ().)\n\nSo the word can imply action or state of being lively, or it could imply that life is being lived out. Please note that this word may have additional connotations depending on the context in which it is used (e.g., relating to style, energy, or living life to the fullest), but in a literal sense, it denotes being livelong or lively."
