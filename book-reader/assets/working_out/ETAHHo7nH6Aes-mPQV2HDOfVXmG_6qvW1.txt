"\nThe text \"そういえば\" can be translated into \"Speaking of which\" or \"By the way\" in English. \n\nIn Japanese, \"そういえば\" is often used as a prefix when bringing up a point that is indirectly related to what is being discussed and introduces a new topic. It's used to alert the listener to a change of subject or to give a transition to a new idea. It can be thought of as a way to say \"Oh dear, and by the way...\" in English. It's a useful conjunction to learn for those looking to master conversational Japanese."
