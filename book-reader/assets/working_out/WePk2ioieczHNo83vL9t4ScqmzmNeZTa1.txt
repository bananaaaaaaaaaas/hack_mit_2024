"\nThe Japanese text stipulates \"Spy x Family\" and \"Tatsuyya Eondo.\" In this context, \"Spy x Family\" is likely a series title, with \"Spy\" signifying that the content involves a spy character. The apostrophe \"x\" is often used to represent multiplication or a bond.\n\nThe name \"Tatsuyya\" is likely an artistic rendition or pseudonym of an author, which is not uncommon in Japanese manga circles. Eondo can be divided into two parts. The endō () refers to an absolute end, suggesting that this tatsuyya (eondo) is the final or conclusive author of the series. The presence of this endō often connotes a high level of artistic achievement, reinforcing a professional and polished image.\n\nThe red circular number \"1\" indicates this is the first volume or installment. The art style and character design are drawn in what seems to be a Shonen manga style, which is popular among both male and female readers in Japan and worldwide.\n\nThis type of Japanese connotation strains the literal sense of the text but is helpful to teach learners how various parts of the text can convey additional meaning."
