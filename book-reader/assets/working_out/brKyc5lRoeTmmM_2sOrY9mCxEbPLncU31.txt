"\nThe Japanese character あ (A) in this context means \"yes.\"\n\nIn Japanese language, \"yes\" is one of the most common and useful vocabulary words to know as a beginner because it's often used to confirm someone's intention or response. The kanji for \"yes\" is lit simplied as ほん ha imi sasenai ayamari (honn, it doesn't have any meaning, wait).\n\nSo, if someone says 「はい」 (hais), it means \"yes.\" Keep in mind that in informal settings, people might also use私家 (jikā), which translates to \"MD\" in the context of music (audio format), but it can also have informal meanings in other settings."
