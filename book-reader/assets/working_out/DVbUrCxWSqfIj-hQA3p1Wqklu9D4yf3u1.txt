"\nそういえば、 (Sou Iceba) means \"Hmm, by the way\" or \"Speaking of...\" in English.\n\nThis phrase is a way to start a new topic in conversation or to remember something one forgot while discussing a previous topic. In Japanese, it can also be used as an expression to show someone has understood or agrees with what was just said, similar to \"As you were saying...\" or \"That's right.\" The Japanese characters optimally translate to \"that is to say.\" However, it's a colloquial phrase more commonly heard in casual conversations or among friends and colleagues."
